# Schema to Scaffold

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/frenesim/schema_to_scaffold)

This Gem shall generate rails commands strings based on a rails database schema you already have.<br>
Generated string commands available are:<br>
`rails generate scaffold <model_name> <field[:type]>`<br>
`rails generate factory_girl:model <ModelName> <field[:type]>`

Important:
This gem will not run code for you. It will only generate a string for you to copy and paste

Use your schema.rb file from `<rails_app>/db` or generated with `rake db:schema:dump`
You can rename schema.rb to schema_your_fav_name.rb that I will find it to. This will prevent schema.rb from being
overwritten when one run rake db:migrate.

SchemaToScaffold will generate rails scaffolding scripts by table like this:

    rails g scaffold users fname:string lname:string bdate:date email:string encrypted_password:string


## Installation

Assuming that you have rubygems-bundler installed, just type:
